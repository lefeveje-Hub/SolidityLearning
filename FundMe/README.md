Yes, these three contracts work well together as a complete system:

FundMe.sol: The main contract that accepts funds, tracks funders, and allows the owner to withdraw all funds.
PriceConverter.sol: A library that provides utility functions to convert between ETH and USD using Chainlink oracles. It's imported and used by FundMe to ensure minimum funding in USD terms.
FallbackExample.sol: This is a separate example contract that demonstrates how receive() and fallback() functions work. It's not directly used by the other two contracts, but showcases the same special functions that FundMe implements.

The system works like this:

FundMe imports PriceConverter and attaches its functions to uint256 values
When someone sends ETH to FundMe, either through the fund() function or by direct transfer:

The receive() or fallback() functions catch direct transfers and route them to fund()
The fund() function uses PriceConverter to check if enough ETH was sent (in USD terms)
If enough was sent, it records the funder and their contribution amount


The contract owner can withdraw all funds using the withdraw() function
